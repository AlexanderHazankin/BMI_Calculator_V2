# BMI_Calculator_V2
 This is one of my exercises from Udemy online Course: "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Yu

This is the second version of my BMI calculator. It gives you as the output is your exact BMI.
NOTE:
*BMI used to predict an individual's health, rather than as a statistical measurement for groups, the BMI has limitations that can make it less useful than some alternatives, especially when applied to individuals with abdominal obesity, short stature, or unusually high muscle mass.
*BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-cause mortality, with the risk increasing with distance from the 20â€“25 range.
