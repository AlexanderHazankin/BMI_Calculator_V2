# BMI Calculator V2
This is the second version of my BMI calculator. It gives you as the output your exact BMI.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

NOTE:
*BMI used to predict an individual's health, rather than as a statistical measurement for groups, the BMI has limitations that can make it less useful than some alternatives, especially when applied to individuals with abdominal obesity, short stature, or unusually high muscle mass.
*BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-cause mortality, with the risk increasing with distance from the 20â€“25 range.
